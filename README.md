# Recipe App

Welcome to the Recipe App, a dynamic web application built using modern web technologies. This app is designed to fetch and display a variety of recipes using a third-party API. It's crafted with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and enhanced with Parcel for bundling.

## Features

- **Modern JavaScript Usage**: ES6+ features for cleaner code and enhanced performance.
- **Parcel Bundler**: Utilizes Parcel for efficient bundling and asset management, improving load times and development experience.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implements OOP principles to structure JavaScript code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- **REST API Integration**: Integrates with a third-party REST API to fetch real-time recipe data, providing users with constantly updated content.
